# Stack-Overflow-Extractor

The problem: 

- Extracting from stackoverflow.com the **10 newest** Android-related questions, as well as the **10 most voted** Android-related questions posted in the **past week**.

- Building a simple website that displays the titles of the extracted questions.

- Providing a convenient way of displaying the full question thread after I click on one of the titles.

- Adding a cool feature that you came up with yourself (Explain the feature in your documentation).
